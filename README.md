# BlockyArena
BlockyArena is a Sponge plugin that enables Minecraft servers to host duels.

## Getting Started
### Downloads
The project is distributed on the Ore Platform maintained by the SpongePowered
team, and the recommended builds can be found on the
[versions](https://ore.spongepowered.org/Darcy_Chen/BlockyArena/versions)
page of the project. If you wish to try out the latest bleeding builds, you may
also navigate to the
[releases](https://github.com/Darcy-Chen/BlockyArena/releases) section of this 
repo and download the JAR file from there.

Please do not download plugins from untrustworthy source.

### Installation
For both SpongeVanilla and SpongeForge, place the JAR file into the `/mods/`
folder of your server directory.

You can also place the JAR file inside the subfolder `/mods/plugins/` if you're
running SpongeForge, as doing so helps distinguish between client-side mods and
server-side plugins.
