## Developer notes
HuskyArena is my first Sponge plugin, so bear with me if any issues occur :sweat_smile:.   
At the moment, HuskyArena has the very basic mechanism of an automated PvP arena, and hopefully more features will be implemented soon.   
Feel free to leave a feedback down below and report any bugs on Github Issues.   
May HuskyArena enrich the combat experience on your server :tada:.
